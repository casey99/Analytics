# All Things Office - Sales Dashboard

Hi all,

I'm sharing my project on the All Things Office sales dashboard! This dashboard provides a clear overview of key sales metrics, helping the company understand its performance and trends. 

I built it using Tableau, incorporating various visualisations to display total sales, profits, and quantities over time, along with subcategory comparisons and weekly trends. 

The interactive nature of the dashboard allows for easy navigation through complex data, enabling the business to see where they can potentialy improve performance.

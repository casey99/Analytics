# Netflix Dashboard Analysis

Hi all,

I'm sharing my project on the Netflix dashboard analysis! This dashboard gives a comprehensive overview of Netflix's content offerings and audience preferences through various visualisations. I built it using Tableau, which allows for detailed analysis of the data, including the total number of movies and TV shows by country, ratings distribution, and the top genres available on the platform.

The interactive features of the dashboard allows the user to explore Netflix's library and gain insights into viewer preferences and trends over the years. The analysis helps in understanding strategic content investments for enhancing audience engagement.
